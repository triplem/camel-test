h1. CAMEL-Test

A small project to test the Apache Camel project and some other useful stuff.

h2. Build Structure

h3. Skip Integration Tests

We decided to separate the Integration Tests from the normal Tests. "Normal" Unit-Tests and Integration Tests are stored
in the same directory structure. Unit-Tests are using the naming structure "**/*Test.java" the Integration Tests are
using the naming structure "**/*IT.java". The failsafe-Plugin is used for the Integration Tests (excluding **/*Test.java,
while the surefire plugin excludes the **/*IT.java files. This means, that tests can be separated using the following
parameters:

* @-DskipITs@ - skip Integration Tests only
* @-DskipTests@ - skip "normal" Tests only
* @-Dmaven.test.skip=true@ - skip all Tests

Reports for the unit-tests can be found in the usual target/surefire-reports-Directory, the reports for the integration-tests
can be found in the directory target/failsafe-reports-Directory, like documented in the
"Failsafe Plugin Documentation":http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-failsafe-plugin/.
